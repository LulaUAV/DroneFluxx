# DroneFluxx Firmware


#### Firmware for the [`DroneFluxx`](https://kylerhess.github.io/flight_controller.html) flight controller.

\
Flight controller hardware is still in work and the design has yet to be made public. Therefore, much of this firmware is very proprietary.
\
\
However, the robust and universal [`PID module`](https://github.com/kyleRhess/DroneFluxx/blob/master/src/PID.c) built for this drone could be useful in other applications.
