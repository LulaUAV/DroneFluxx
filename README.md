# DroneFluxx

## A custom quadcopter flight controller

### Firmware

The current firmware version is tailored for an STM32F4 microcontroller. This means that it is best-suited for the related hardware, and much of this firmware is very proprietary.
\
However, the lightweight [`PID module`](https://github.com/kyleRhess/DroneFluxx/blob/master/src/PID.c) built for this project could be useful in other applications.

### Hardware

Flight controller hardware is still in work, [`but has been made public`](https://github.com/kyleRhess/DroneFluxx/tree/master/Hardware) for those who are interested.
